# Shiny_cars

Supercars are fast, exciting, exotic, and irresistible. One of the topics that I’m enthusiastic about is cars, and this is the reason today I decided to explore different topics and trends that people are currently talking about among major supercar automakers.

The purpose of this work is to visualize and gain insightful information from raw qualitative data or descriptive information from an open source data Twitter, about customers’ brand attitudes among five major automobile companies:

Tesla,
Porsche AG
Audi AG
BMW
Mercedes-Benz


 

 


The major focus are factors that play a major role influencing customers’ attention and brand attractiveness including current brand perception, and product attributes from car features to individual driving experiences.
