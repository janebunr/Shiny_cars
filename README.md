# Shiny_cars

## Approach

To approach, I'll crawl data from Twitter using Twitter API in the total of 150,000 tweets (30,000 tweets each car brand), analyze using text analysis and topic model to visualize insightful information using R Programming. The book that I use to refer to is Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach by Julia Silge and David Robinson.
